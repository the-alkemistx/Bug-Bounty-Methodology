### **Phase 1: Preparation and Setup**

#### 1. **Choose the Right Platforms**
   - Focus on platforms with active programs and wide scopes:
     - **HackerOne**: High-paying programs and diverse targets.
     - **Bugcrowd**: Beginner-friendly with regular updates.
     - **Intigriti**: European-focused with unique opportunities.
     - **Synack**: Offers vetted targets with guaranteed payouts.

   **Pro Tip**: Select programs offering wildcard domains and APIs, as they provide broader attack surfaces.

#### 2. **Set Up Your Tools**

Install and configure the following:
   - **Reconnaissance**:
     - Amass, Subfinder, Assetfinder, MassDNS.
   - **Scanning**:
     - Nmap, Burp Suite (Community/Pro), ffuf.
   - **Automation**:
     - EyeWitness, Aquatone, Hakrawler, Gospider.
   - **Exploitation**:
     - SQLmap, XSStrike, wfuzz.
   - **Browser Extensions**:
     - Wappalyzer, Cookie-Editor, Postman, SAML Raider.

   **Pro Tip**: Use Docker to simplify tool installation and management for tools like Gospider and nuclei.

#### 3. **Understand Vulnerabilities**
   - Focus on high-probability, high-impact vulnerabilities:
     - **High Probability**: IDOR, XSS, Authentication flaws.
     - **High Impact**: SQL Injection, SSRF, RCE.
   - Learn from resources like OWASP Web Security Testing Guide, PortSwigger Academy, and disclosed bug reports.

### **Phase 2: Reconnaissance**

#### 1. **Passive Recon**
   - **Discover Subdomains**:
     - Run `amass enum -passive -d target.com`.
     - Use `assetfinder --subs-only target.com`.
   - **Aggregate Results**:
     - Combine and deduplicate: `cat all_subs.txt | sort -u > subs_final.txt`.
   - **Google Dorking**:
     - Use queries like:
       - `"site:target.com" intitle:index.of`
       - `"site:target.com" inurl:admin`

#### 2. **Active Recon**
   - Probe subdomains for live hosts:
     - `cat subs_final.txt | httprobe > live_subs.txt`.
   - Capture screenshots:
     - `aquatone -out screenshots/ -threads 20 -list live_subs.txt`.
   - Perform content discovery with ffuf:
     ```bash
     ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -u https://target.com/FUZZ
     ```

   **Pro Tip**: Automate recon tasks with custom scripts to monitor for new subdomains or endpoints.

### **Phase 3: Targeted Testing**

#### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Test Authentication Flaws**:
     - Check for weak login protections or bypass methods.
     - Attempt SQL Injection payloads:
       ```sql
       ' OR '1'='1' --
       ```
   - **Authorization Issues**:
     - Look for IDOR vulnerabilities in API endpoints.
     - Test for privilege escalation between user roles.

#### 2. **Input Validation**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
     - Test payload: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
   - **SQL Injection**:
     - Use SQLmap for automated testing:
       ```bash
       sqlmap -u "https://target.com?id=1" --batch
       ```
   - **File Uploads**:
     - Upload files with malicious content (e.g., `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`).

#### 3. **Manual Testing**
   - Explore login pages, admin panels, and sensitive endpoints manually.
   - Check cookies for sensitive data or insecure configurations (e.g., lack of `httpOnly` or `Secure` flags).

#### 4. **Advanced Techniques**
   - Test for misconfigurations using nuclei:
     ```bash
     nuclei -l live_subs.txt -t misconfigurations/
     ```
   - Identify CORS misconfigurations and SSRF opportunities.

   **Pro Tip**: Always compare client-side and server-side validations to uncover bypass opportunities.

### **Phase 4: Reporting**

#### 1. **Craft an Impactful Report**
   - **Title**: Clear and concise (e.g., `IDOR in /api/user`).
   - **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide detailed steps with screenshots or videos.
   - **Impact**: Explain the real-world risk (e.g., unauthorized access to user data).

#### 2. **Tips for High Acceptance**
   - Validate findings thoroughly before submission.
   - Include remediation suggestions.
   - Reference standards like OWASP or CVEs where applicable.

---

### **Phase 5: Scaling to $1000+/Week**

#### 1. **Target Multiple Programs**
   - Focus on **new or less competitive programs**.
   - Prioritize targets with APIs and subdomains.

#### 2. **Time Management**
   - Dedicate **4–6 hours/day** for hunting.
   - Start with quick wins (e.g., XSS, IDOR) before exploring deeper vulnerabilities.

#### 3. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**
   - Use tools like Chaos to monitor for new subdomains.
   - Set up notifications for new program launches or scope expansions.

#### 4. **Leverage Community and Resources**
   - Join bug bounty forums (e.g., HackerOne Slack, Bugcrowd Discord).
   - Learn from experienced hunters and disclosed reports.

   **Pro Tip**: Collaborate with other hunters to tackle larger scopes or share knowledge.

### **Final Tips for Success**

1. **Focus on Business Impact**: Prioritize vulnerabilities with real-world implications.
2. **Stay Persistent**: Success often comes from consistent efforts and refining your methodology.
3. **Learn Continuously**: Regularly update your skills with training platforms like HackTheBox or TryHackMe.
4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Even duplicates contribute to your learning and experience.

By following this refined approach, you’ll develop a methodical workflow that maximizes efficiency and increases your chances of earning $1000 or more per week consistently.
